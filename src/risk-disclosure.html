                        The following is a general risk disclosure statement for the use of trading bots offered by
                        trentobot.com. Please note that this is not tailored to the specific products and services
                        offered by trentobot.com and is only intended to provide a general understanding of the risks
                        involved in using trading bots.
                        Trading in financial markets, including foreign exchange (FX), stocks, futures, options, and
                        cryptocurrencies, involves substantial risk and is not suitable for all investors. The use of
                        trading bots, including those offered by trentobot.com, does not guarantee profit or eliminate
                        the risk of loss.


                    </p>
                    <p class="lg:text-base text-sm leading-normal text-gray-600">
                        Past performance of trading bots or any other trading method is not indicative of future
                        results. The markets are subject to sudden and significant price fluctuations, which may result
                        in large losses. The use of leverage can magnify these potential losses.
                        Trading bots rely on algorithms and mathematical models to make trading decisions, which are
                        based on historical market data and statistical analysis. These models are subject to inherent
                        limitations, including the fact that they may not always make accurate predictions or respond
                        appropriately to changing market conditions.

                    <p class="lg:text-base text-sm leading-normal text-gray-600">
                        Trading bots can also be vulnerable to errors, bugs, and hacking. If a trading bot malfunctions,
                        it may cause significant losses. Trentobot.com does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness
                        of any information provided through its trading bots and will not be held liable for any errors
                        or omissions.

                        It is important to thoroughly understand the features, benefits, and risks of the trading bots

                        objectives, level of experience, and risk tolerance before using trading bots. You should also
